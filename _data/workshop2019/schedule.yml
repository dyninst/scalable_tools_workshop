      slides: lam-stw19.pdf
      abstract: "Floating-point representation and arithmetic remain the predominant mechanism
    for real-valued computation despite many well-known issues such as roundoff
    error. As high-performance computing continues to scale, many computational
    scientists are seeking to reduce precision when possible to accelerate
    performance and alleviate memory requirements. In this talk, I will describe
    my recent work that seeks to facilitate such reduction of precision or in
    some other way provide insights about the accuracy or behavior of
    floating-point code, including a recent experimental prototype of an
    end-to-end source-level mixed-precision tuning system for HPC codes."

    - title: "Does your tool support PAPI SDEs yet?"
      author: Anthony Danalis
      affiliation: Univ. of Tennessee
      length: 1800
      slides: "2019_07_ScalableToolsWorkshop_Danalis.pdf"
      abstract: "In the past, PAPI development had focused primarily on hardware-specific
    performance metrics. However, the rapidly increasing complexity of software
    infrastructure poses new measurement and analysis challenges for the
    developers of large-scale applications that make use of external libraries
    and runtimes. 

    In this talk, we will discuss our efforts to extend PAPI's role so that it becomes
    the de facto standard for exposing Software-Defined Events (SDEs), or in
    other words performance-critical events that originate from within layers of
    the software stack. Extending PAPI with SDEs enables tools to acquire a more
    complete picture regarding application performance, by monitoring both types
    of performance events---hardware and software---in a uniform way, through the
    same consistent PAPI interface.

    In addition to describing the functionality we offer through PAPI's SDE interface,
    we will show examples of how SDEs have been utilized by different software
    packages, and provide a thorough performance analysis of the overhead that
    results from inserting SDEs into performance critical codes."

    - title: "A Common Tools Interface as an MPIR Alternative"
      author: Andrew Gontarek
      affiliation: Cray 
      length: 1800
      slides: "cti_presentation.pdf"
      abstract: "The Common Tools Interface (CTI) is an infrastructure framework focused on enabling tool developers to interact with,
and run tool daemons alongside, applications on HPC systems. CTI is a collection of interfaces along with underlying
utilities that export services for use by tools. The goal of CTI is to define a set of interfaces that provide a tight 
semantic mapping between tools and the underlying HPC system. Tools have a common set of core functionality required 
during bootstrapping to start daemons alongside running application processes. CTI enables vendors to provide 
underlying implementations invisible to the interfacing tool to rapidly enable support on their systems. 

CTI was inspired by the MPIR Process Acquisition Interface and is meant to be a more robust replacement. A problem 
with the current MPIR design is that a tool is required to ptrace attach onto the starter process in order to harvest 
information about the running application. This is not a good fit for current HPC system designs. Some systems allow 
for intermediary nodes between where the user starts their application and where the starter process is actually run, 
requiring tools to route themselves to the node where the starter process resides. CTI solves this by providing an 
abstract API that allows the underlying implementation to handle the details transparent to the tool.

Cray recently open sourced CTI as a reference implementation that can be used to explore future work related to 
defining a cross vendor tool interface suited for the modern era of HPC systems."

    - title: "Hatchet: Pruning the Overgrowth in Parallel Profiles"
      author: Abhinav Bhatele
      affiliation:  LLNL
      length: 1800
      abstract: "Performance analysis of parallel codes is critical to ensure high efficiency and scalability to large process counts. A large number of profiling tools exist to instrument codes and gather performance data. However, analytics and visualization tools to analyze such data that are effective, easy-to-use, and programmable are limited. In this paper, we focus on the analytics of structured profiling data such as that obtained from calling context trees or nested region timers in the code. We present a set of techniques and operations that leverage modern data analysis libraries for parallel profile analysis. We have implemented these techniques in a Python-based library called Hatchet, that allows structured data to be filtered, aggregated, and pruned.  Using performance datasets obtained from profiling parallel codes, we demonstrate how common performance analyses can be performed in a reproducible manner with only a few lines of Hatchet code."

    - title: "I/O Recording and Workflow Analysis with Score-P and Vampir"
      author: Bill Williams
      affiliation: TU Dresden
      length: 1800
      slides: "Williams_WorkflowIO_STW19.pdf"
      abstract: "As HPC tasks become larger and more complex, developers attempt to address
    this complexity by decomposing problems into a workflow of simpler applications,
    rather than a single application that can handle everything. These workflows
    present multiple challenges to the tools community, but one of the chief problems
    is the analysis of communication between jobs. In many workflows, the filesystem
    plays an analogous role in inter-job communication to that of MPI in interprocess
    communication. This suggests that we should adapt familiar techniques from MPI
    instrumentation and performance analysis to the I/O domain. We present initial
    work in enabling this analysis:

    * New I/O recording features in the ScoreP measurement system
    * A prototype suite of tools for HPC workflow instrumentation
    * A prototype visualisation tool for analysing and displaying the results of this
      instrumentation
    * Preliminary results in automatically determining the I/O dependencies within a
      workflow

    Our ultimate goal is to provide the user with information about how they can
    restructure their workflow in order to increase parallelism, improve the
    efficiency of their use of HPC resources, and reduce or eliminate false
    dependencies between jobs."

    - title: "Exploiting Modern Hardware Features via Lightweight Profiling"
      author: Probir Roy
      affiliation: College of William and Mary
      length: 1800
      slides: "scalable_tools_workshop_probir_for_pdf.pdf"
      abstract: "Over the past few decades, computer systems have evolved into two
    directions: more parallelism and deeper memory hierarchies. Software
    needs to make an adaption to efficiently map itself to the modern
    and emerging architectures for the optimal performance. My research
    involves building various tools to pinpoint inefficient hardware-
    software interactions and guide code optimization. In this talk, I
    will discuss different forms of inefficiencies originating from
    modern computer architectures: contention across simultaneous
    multithreading, cache conflicts, and bandwidth under-utilization. I
    will then present novel analysis tools to identify these
    inefficiencies with low overhead. Guided by our tools, we can
    successfully optimize program inefficiencies, which yields
    significant speedups."

    - title: "Performance Analysis of Very Large Shared Memory Systems Using Intel(R) Optane DC
 Memory"
      author: Ramesh Peri
      affiliation: Intel 
      length: 1800
      abstract: "There is a new kind of memory that was announced recently called Intel(R)
    Optane DC memory which is lot more dense than traditional DRAM but with more
    access latency. This introduces a new layer in the memory hierarchy and allows
    systems with many TB of main memory to be built and use existing DDR4 as
    another layer of cache. In this talk I will introduce the tools we built to
    analyze performance on such large scale systems. I will also share our
    experiences in using the performance tools to optimize  graph analytics
    algorithms on very large graphs, containing billions of vertices and trillions
    of edges, on this system.
