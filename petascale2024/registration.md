Scalable Tools Workshop 2024 will be held at the
beautiful <a href="https://www.granlibakken.com">Granlibakken Resort</a> in Lake Tahoe,
California.

<b>[Registration](https://www.secure.granlibakken.net/conference/forms/TOOLS24XXX_form.asp)</b>: This will
be handled directly by the resort. Note that the cost is all-inclusive, including meeting registration, lodging, and meals.

Once you have registered with Granlibakken, please allow them 1 - 2 business days to process, at which point you should get an email with your confirmation number. If you do not receive a confirmation, you can call them at (530) 583-4242.

<b>Ground transportation</b>: If you need transportation between Reno Airport and Granlibakken, you can arrange a shuttle by contacting [North Lake Tahoe Express](https://www.northlaketahoeexpress.com/). The cost is $99 per person each way for a single rider, and drops to $70 per person for 2 or more riders. You might also consider renting a car. Note that the Granlibakken meeting registration page asks about your arrival and departure flights. You can ignore this part of the form as Granlibakken no longer arranges ground transportation.
